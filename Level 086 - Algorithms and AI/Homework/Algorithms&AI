Program Speed Comparsion:
-Time complexity
-Memory Complexity

Program Difficulty: O


We can prove that there's 1 bit difference between
2's compement and excess by adding them

(2^n - D) + (D - 2^(n-1)) = 2^n - 2^(n-1)=
=2^(n-1)(2-1)=2^(n - 1)

2^(n - 1) in binary is always number with one 1 in
left and then after only zeros (e.g 1000)

Conclusion:
If we sum 2 numbers and we get all same results except last bit
that proves only difference between those numbers is 1 bit to left

Creating C Program Steps
-Creating .c extension file
-Preprocessing (at this stage every whitespace and comments will be removed)
-Result getting .i extension file that is directed after preprocessing
-Compiling (on this stage from current file we get assembly file .s extension, -S key)
-Assembling




Commands:
-ls -lh view  - files in directory
-./filename   - run program
-S -D -c      - keys
-mkdir        - make directory
