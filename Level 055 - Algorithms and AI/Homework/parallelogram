Algorithms&AI Day 55:

Task: Prove that second diagonal in paralleogram is indeed subtraction of vectors a and b.

Soultion:
If we represent points: O,A,B and C as it is on image and name vectors in order:
➡OA = a, ➡OB = b, subtraction of these vectors ➡ would be b - a
as ➡OA - ➡OB = ➡AB, b - a would be ➡AB

Conclusion:

The second diagonal in paralleogram is indeed subtraction of vectors a and b.
