Task:

How would you test the word count program? What kinds of
input are more likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Soultion:

To test word_count.c I would compile it then run in mate terminal
If there are any bugs, inputs like only spaces or whitespaces which
count isn't power of 4 might result in bug, also input ending with new line
