Analyazed and compiled word_count.c into sityvebis_datvla
then executed sityvebis_datvla executable file

Preprocessed IN variable as 1 in word_count and OUT as 0
used IN and OUT variable to represent states of program
to check if we're reviewing word or are outside of word

Reassiging state variable OUT if c (char) is space, new_line or tab
becasue if char is any of these characters then we've started new word
and if char was none of these characters then reassiging char IN
because we haven't started new word as there's no blank serperating


Also compiled word_count program to gsityvebis_datvla file
for debugging

Debugged digit counter algorithm in c

history - mate terminal command that displays all stored terminal ran commands

gdb bash commands:
gdb -tui fileName - executing file with debugger
enter - continue paging
arrows - move command or code based on which window is selected
focus (fs) - move arrow keys to work on different window
cmd - mate terminal window
src - gdb debugger window
next (n) - switch between windows
layout - change gdb debugger view
winheight (wh) src (+/-) value - incerese or decerase window height
start - run program
display variable - Display variable value
print value - outputs ASCI decimal representation of number
print/x - outputs ASCI hexadecimal representation of number


Debugger layout:
1. code
2. assembler
3. code, assembler
4. registry


declaring varaible without initializing might result in unexcepted value
default initializing variable might be different between computers based
on what value was stored there 

In order to create file that allows preprocessed macros to be
treated as variables, there is need to reference special key
